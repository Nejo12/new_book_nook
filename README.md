// In your terminal run the code below (replace "URL" with the url you copied)
git clone URL

// Install all dependencies for client & backend, cd into individual directories. (e.g. cd /backend && npm install).
npm install

// From base folder, run client & development server with concurrently
npm run dev

// Assumes Node and npm are installed on machine
// Server runs on http://localhost:5001 (set in server.js) and client on http://localhost:3000 (default for Create React App)

// Run test individual from either the backend or client's folder
npm test
